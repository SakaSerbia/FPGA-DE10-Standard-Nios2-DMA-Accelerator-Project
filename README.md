# FPGA-DE10-Standard-Nios2-DMA-Accelerator-Project
Demonstrate the operation of various Avalon bus interfaces and hardware integration module within the processor system. Develop acceleration of the system that performs linear computing functions, Y = AX + B, large amounts of data. 

 # Installation
To start the project you need the following programs:

- FPGA DE10-Standard or FPGA with similar possibilities 
- Quartus (Quartus Prime 18.1 or any later version) Lite Edition
- Nios II Software Build Tools for Eclipse (Quartus Prime 18.1 or any later version)
